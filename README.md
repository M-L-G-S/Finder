Yelp optionals————————
- insert restaurant, use yelp api to auto fill information about the type of food. so say i put in shizen, it would add tags to the post "vegan" "sushi" "japanese" etc. and the user can of course remove them. (maybe only add if user says autofill)
- save location in case sort by location. very optional
———————————— 

Instagram optionals————————
- user gives link to an instagram post, import photo, post description, time/date, etc - and add it to food diary
- user gives instagram account, get all the photos, allow user to select all posts they want to import
